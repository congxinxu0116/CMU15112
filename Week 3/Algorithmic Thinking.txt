Step 1: understand the problem
- Define it precisely
    - what are the input
    - what are the output
    - what constraints exist?

- Could you describe the problem to someone well 
    enough for them to pass the same test cases?


Step 2: Devising a Plan
- Identify the level of problem solving needed
    - Translate, translate equations to python code
    - Apply, apply patterns to new problems
    - Generate, generate a new algorithm
        - Induction 
        - Top-Down Design
        - Human Computer

Step 3: Carry out the plan

Step 4: Review your work
